**Enhanced fork with Spam Folder Feature** 🚀

This is a personal fork of [Fossify Messages](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Messages) with additional spam management capabilities.

## ✨ New Features in This Fork

### 📬 **SPAM FOLDER MANAGEMENT**
Take complete control over unwanted messages with a dedicated spam folder:
- **Manual Spam Marking:** Long-press any conversation and mark it as spam
- **Automatic Spam Detection:** Messages from blocked numbers or containing blocked keywords automatically go to spam
- **Review Before Delete:** Spam messages are saved for review, not immediately deleted
- **No Spam Notifications:** Spam messages won't disturb you with notifications
- **Empty Spam Folder:** Bulk delete all spam conversations when ready
- **Unmark Spam:** Easily restore conversations if marked by mistake

**How It Works:**
1. Mark conversations as spam via context menu
2. View spam folder from main menu
3. Blocked numbers/keywords automatically trigger spam detection
4. Review and permanently delete or restore as needed

### ♻️ **RECYCLE BIN FOR CONVERSATIONS**
Avoid accidental data loss with full Recycle Bin support:
- **Conversation Recovery:** Deleting a conversation now moves it to the Recycle Bin instead of permanently deleting it
- **Full Restoration:** Restore entire conversations including all messages and media
- **Auto-Cleanup:** (Optional) Configure automatic deletion of old recycled items
- **Safe Delete:** Gives you a second chance if you delete the wrong thread
